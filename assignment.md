## assignment: analysis of Nobel laureate data

### overview

We reconstructed an analysis reported by
[Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/immigration-and-science)
on the birth place of living Nobel laureates who received their Nobel prize
while residents of the United States. In this assignment, we will address a
similar analysis for living Nobel laureatues outside of the United States. All
of the R code has been provided for you, but you will need to provide some
set-up and concluding text around the graphical output. A few sentences of text
setting up the analysis and interpreting the output is more than adequate, the
goals here are not to conduct a detailed analysis of these data but to provide
additional practice working with Git, GitHub, R, RStudio, and R/markdown.

### details

Complete the analysis of Nobel laureate data in the R directory of the
repository assigned to you. Refer to the Readme of the respository for an
overview of the data, data structure, and approach. Refer to our earlier
analysis of [San Diego Airbnb](https://github.com/SOS598-RDM/airbnb-san-diego)
data for an overview of working with RStudio, Git, and GitHub.

### grading criteria:

1. introductory and concluding text added to Rmd document
2. knit Rmd to md
3. push output of knit (md and all supporting files) to GitHub

View the output on GitHub to be sure that the output is as you expect (e.g.,
text, figures, and code (if relevant) are displayed without broken links).
