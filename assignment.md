## assignment: analysis of Nobel laureate data

### overview

We reconstructed an analysis reported by
[Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/immigration-and-science)
on the birth place of living Nobel laureates who received their Nobel prize
while residents of the United States. In this assignment, we will address a
similar analysis for living Nobel laureatues outside of the United States. All
of the R code has been provided for you, but you will need to provide some
set-up and concluding text around the graphical output. A few sentences of text
setting up the analysis and interpreting the output is more than adequate, the
goals here are not to conduct a detailed analysis of these data but to provide
additional practice working with Git, GitHub, R, RStudio, and R/markdown.

### details

Complete the analysis of Nobel laureate data in the R directory of the
repository assigned to you. Refer to the Readme of the respository for an
overview of the data, data structure, and approach. Refer to our earlier
analysis of [San Diego Airbnb](https://github.com/SOS598-RDM/airbnb-san-diego)
data for an overview of working with RStudio, Git, and GitHub.

### grading criteria:

1. introductory and concluding text added to Rmd document
2. knit Rmd to md
3. push output of knit (md and all supporting files) to GitHub

**View the output on GitHub to be sure that the output is as you expect (e.g.,
text, figures, and code (if relevant) are displayed without broken links).**
